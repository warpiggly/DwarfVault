        <h2>HISTORY</h2>
        <p>In ancient times, long before the great cities were built, in the hidden valleys of deep mountains, there existed a race known as the Dwarves, masters of forging and guardians of ancestral knowledge. These Dwarves not only forged metals but also stored the world's wisdom in secret chambers: writings, maps, artifacts of power, and secrets no other being could decipher. These chambers were known as The Vaults, sanctuaries of knowledge.</p>
        <p>Over the centuries, the era of the Dwarves faded, and their secrets were buried beneath mountains of rock and time. However, a small order of forging Dwarves refused to let their race's knowledge vanish forever. With the dawn of a new age, they decided to reopen the Vaults, but this time, they would not be mere stone chambers. They would create a magical and technological tool to preserve, manage, and protect everything the heart wished to store.</p>
        <p>Thus was born "The Dwarf’s Vault," a magical extension created to help digital travelers organize their own knowledge and treasures. With this extension, you, noble user, can create your own databases, just as the ancient forgers organized their chambers. Every text, every file, every secret you save will be preserved in the vast digital halls of the Vault. But that’s not all—you will also have the power to organize, edit, and share it when needed, all under the protection of ancient Dwarven enchantments.</p>
        <p>The Dwarf’s Vault is made for those who seek not only to store information but to protect it, just as the Dwarves safeguarded their most valuable relics. May the runes and forges guide you, keeper of secrets, and may your knowledge remain safe in this world and the many yet to come!</p>
